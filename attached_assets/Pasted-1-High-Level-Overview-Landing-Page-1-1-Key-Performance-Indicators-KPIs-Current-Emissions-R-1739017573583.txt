1. High-Level Overview / Landing Page
1.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

    Current Emissions Rate (CO₂): e.g., “250 kg CO₂/hour” or “50 g CO₂/kWh”
    Energy Mix: Real-time breakdown of power sources: fossil vs. renewable vs. battery.
    Cost per MWh: The running cost (in $ or local currency) of producing or purchasing each MWh of electricity.
    Savings to Date: How much cost (and how many tons of CO₂) have been saved thanks to AI optimization compared to a baseline or historical average.

1.2 Quick Alerts

    System Health Status: Flags if any sensor or subsystem is out of expected range (e.g., battery temperature too high).
    Anomalies or Errors: Urgent notifications for equipment faults, major drops in efficiency, or safety boundary violations.

A visual snapshot on the landing page ensures that users can quickly gauge the system’s overall health and financial/environmental metrics at a glance.
2. Real-Time / Near Real-Time Operational View
2.1 Live Energy Flow Diagram

    A dynamic flow chart or Sankey diagram that shows how power is moving:
        Fossil Generator → how much power it’s producing, associated CO₂ rate.
        Renewable Source(s) (solar, wind, etc.) → how much is currently available/produced.
        Battery State → level of charge, how quickly it’s charging or discharging.
        Load (Demand) → total consumption, any unmet demand.
    Helps operators see, in real time, which source is being used and how the AI is balancing them.

2.2 Time-Series Charts

    Stacked Area Chart of power contribution: fossil, renewable, battery discharge.
    Emissions vs. time (kg CO₂/hour) overlayed with cost.
    Battery SoC (state of charge) over the day.
    These can auto-refresh on a set interval (e.g., every minute or 5 minutes).

3. AI Recommendations & Action Log
3.1 Recommended Setpoints

    A panel listing the AI’s latest recommendations:
        “Decrease fossil generator output to 40%,” or
        “Charge battery until 80% by 2 PM,” or
        “Schedule high-energy processes in 1 hour, when solar output peaks.”

3.2 Operator Overrides

    A place to accept or decline each recommendation.
    If operators choose to override, they can note the rationale (e.g., maintenance scheduling, safety protocols).
    This fosters human-in-the-loop collaboration, building trust in the AI’s decisions.

3.3 Action Log / History

    Tracks what was recommended, what was done, and the resulting impact.
    Lets managers review past decisions and see how they improved (or worsened) cost or emissions.

4. Historical Data & Analytics
4.1 Time-Series Archives

    Operators can specify date ranges to examine system performance (past day, week, month, year).
    Charts showing emissions, fuel consumption, renewable utilization, and battery usage over time.
    Comparisons with baseline (e.g., “no AI” scenario or last year’s performance).

4.2 Trend Analysis & Forecasting

    Demand Forecast: AI-projected demand for the next few hours/days (if you have a predictive model).
    Renewable Forecast: e.g., expected solar or wind generation based on weather data.
    Emissions Forecast: predicted CO₂ output if current operational strategy continues.

4.3 Scenario Comparison

    Let users run “what-if” simulations:
        “What if we expanded the battery capacity by 30%?”
        “What if we had 20% more solar capacity?”
    Show potential changes in cost/emissions on charts or in summary stats.

5. Maintenance & Anomaly Detection
5.1 Equipment Health Dashboard

    Maintenance Schedules: upcoming checks for turbines, boilers, battery health, etc.
    Anomaly Detection Alerts: AI flags if equipment is deviating from normal efficiency, or if sensor data suggests a pending failure (e.g., high vibration in a turbine).

5.2 Recommended Maintenance Actions

    “Clean heat exchanger #2,” or “Inspect valve #3 for leaks,” each with a predicted emissions/cost impact if not addressed.
    Over time, the system could track how quickly operators respond to anomalies and the resulting improvements.

6. User Management & Settings
6.1 Role-Based Access

    Operator Role: sees real-time data, can implement or override AI actions.
    Manager Role: sees financial metrics, system-wide analytics, can set longer-term strategy.
    Administrator Role: manages user permissions, integrations, system configurations.

6.2 System Configuration

    Emission Factors: define the CO₂ intensity for fossil fuels, so the dashboard is region-specific or updated if new carbon pricing policies appear.
    Cost Factors: set or update local fuel costs, electricity prices, or any carbon tax/credit.
    Constraints: safety or operational constraints (max temperature, min battery SoC, etc.).

7. Reporting & Export
7.1 Automated Reports

    Daily/Weekly/Monthly PDF or Excel summaries emailed to stakeholders.
    Summaries might include total energy produced, total emissions, cost savings, key incidents, and recommended improvements.

7.2 On-Demand Exports

    The user can export CSV files or Excel workbooks from any chart or data table in the dashboard for deeper offline analysis.

8. Tech Stack & Implementation Notes

Although the above sections describe what the dashboard shows, below are some details about how to implement it:

    Frontend Framework:
        React, Vue, or Angular for a responsive, single-page app.
        Charting Libraries: Chart.js, Highcharts, Plotly, or D3.js for dynamic visuals.

    Backend & APIs:
        REST or GraphQL endpoints to fetch current and historical data from your AI engine’s database or simulation logs.
        Real-time events using WebSockets or Socket.IO if you want truly live updates.

    Database:
        Time-series or relational database (e.g., InfluxDB for streaming sensor data, or PostgreSQL/MySQL for aggregated data).

    Authentication & Security:
        OAuth or JWT-based token authentication.
        Role-based access control to restrict certain pages or actions.

    Cloud Hosting:
        Host as a SaaS or on the client’s premises, depending on data privacy needs.

9. Putting It All Together: User Journey Example

    Login: The operator logs in and lands on the Overview page, seeing top-level metrics: total cost, total emissions, system health.
    Check Real-Time View: They see the current hour’s power split—fossil, renewable, battery—and confirm everything is stable.
    Review AI Recommendations: The dashboard highlights “Lower fossil generation for the next 2 hours; we’ll rely more on battery to reduce CO₂ by ~5%.” The operator can accept or override.
    Investigate an Alert: There’s a minor anomaly—AI detects a small drop in turbine efficiency. The operator checks the “Maintenance” page, sees recommended cleaning.
    Historical Report: After a day or a week, the manager checks the “Analytics” page to see how overall emissions and costs compare to last month.
    Scheduled Email: The system automatically sends a weekly PDF summary to all stakeholders, highlighting progress on carbon footprint and any missed maintenance tasks.
